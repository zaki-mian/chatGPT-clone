ChatGPT has gained significant popularity in recent months or years, completely changing how we interact with automated chatbots. As a beginner web developer, you might be curious about creating your own ChatGPT. The good news is that it is possible to create a ChatGPT clone using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

After cloning code do these things first:

1: use your chatGPT-API-key from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys  and paste the api key in script.js file
2: add image folder and add avatar/images in it for user and chatbot image, give the path of your images/avatar in scrcipt.js file
